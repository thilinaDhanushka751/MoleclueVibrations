# Molecular Vibration Simulation

This project is a web-based simulation that demonstrates the molecular vibrations of a CO₂ molecule using Matter.js and SVG graphics. The simulation showcases how photons interact with the molecule, resulting in various vibrational motions.

## Features

- Simulates CO₂ molecule vibrations.
- Displays photon emission and absorption effects.
- Visual representation of bond stretching and molecular rotation.
- Interactive interface to observe molecular behavior.
